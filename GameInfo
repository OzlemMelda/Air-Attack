Air attack is a game that’s main purpose is to stay alive by destroying bombs and aircrafts. In two ways game can end, when your health point is zero or when you are out of ammunation. 
Objects are tank, aircraft, package, bomb and fire. The user controls a tank which has three possible moves, that is, moving right, moving left and firing. Tank has ability to create fire object which destroys aircrafts, bombs and packages. To receive the packages, the user shouldn’t shot the packages and the package should touch the tank when it arrives at the bottom line. The bomb is dropped by the aircraft and the packages are dropped from the aircrafts when the user shots the aircraft. There are three types of aircrafts in our game: plane, helicopter and supersonic. Helicopter is the slowest type of aircrafts and drops three bombs while it is seen on the screen, supersonic is the fastest one and drops only one bomb, and the plane drops two bombs. There are two types of packages: red one increases health point by one when it is received and the blue one increases the number of bullets by five. 
As explained above, the game can end in two ways: when the health point is zero or when the number of ammunation is zero. The number of ammunation decreases by one each time the user fires. The number of ammunation increases by five when a helicopter is shot, it increases by four when a plane is shot, and increases by three when a supersonic is shot or increases by five when the user receives a blue package. Health point decreases by one for each bomb that the user cannot shot and the health point increases by one when the red package is received.
